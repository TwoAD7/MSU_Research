> This folder contains preliminary LISE++ files for optimal configurations using NSCL and FRIB facilities
to study isotopes Mg 32 through Mg 40. 

> All NSCL and FRIB files have been set to dp/p = 1%; at the I2_Slits and the pre-separator focal
plane (O4_PS_FP), respectively.

> To allow for largest intenisty possible on the FRIB LISE++ configuration, the pre-separator 
slits (PS_Wedge_Slits) are set to the aperture limit, 135 mm. Wedges and momentum acceptances were 
later adjusted downstream to yield optimal purity results without large comprimise to intensity. 
Beware to user, the momentum acceptance changes downstream and requires one to keep this in 
mind. 

> All NSCL files have FP_Slits set to 10 mm and have purity greater than 91%.

> All FRIB files have purity greater than 92%. 

> FRIB intensities are all 2-3 orders of magnitude greater than NSCL intensities.  

> For isotopes Mg 38 and Mg 40, there are 2-3 LISE++ files for each isotope. Each file is a 
different compromise on purity and intensity for the corresponding isotope. The intensities 
that are used in the UPDATE presentation are from Mg_40_FRIB_3 and Mg_38_FRIB_3.
